Hi, I'm Shuo Han (韩朔 in Chinese). I'm currently looking for a full-time internship till August 2020.

From March 2019 to November 2019, I was fortunate to work as a research assistant at Cornell Autonomous Driving Group and the Department of Computer Science, where I was advised by [Prof. Kilian Q. Weinberger](http://kilian.cs.cornell.edu/) and [Prof. Wei-Lun Chao](http://www-scf.usc.edu/~weilunc/index.html). My research focus is on the stereo depth estimation and amodal instance segmentation.

In December 2018, I received my Master of Engineering degree in environmental engineering at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), under the supervision of [Dr. Monroe Weber-Shirk](https://www.cee.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/monroe-weber-shirk-0). In [AguaClara Cornell](http://aguaclara.cornell.edu/), we utilized computer vision and implemented an app to detect flocs in the water, facilitating the municipal water treatment process. I received a Bachelor of Engineering degree in environmental engineering at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn/) in June 2017 ([C.V.](https://sh2439.github.io/Resume_shuo.pdf)).

Also, I play [basketball](https://sh2439.github.io/basketball/)!
