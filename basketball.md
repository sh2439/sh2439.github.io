- I'm not professional, but I'm a huge fan.
- From 2015 to 2016, I was a member of the [**Basketball Team of Tongji University**](img/basketball/tongji_basketball.jpg). I participated in the 18th CUBA (Chinese University Basketball Association) Tournament in Shanghai.
- At Cornell, our [team](img/basketball/cornell_basketball.jpeg) won the 2nd place in the intramural basketball tournament in 2019.
